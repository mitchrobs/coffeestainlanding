                    <br />

                    <p>"So, like, what's your major?"</p>

                    <p>"Did you see that one article on Onward State from yesterday?"</p>

                    <p>"But, like, honestly, do you think I should send this Snapchat?"</p>

                    <p>"What would you tell a 10-year-old version of yourself right now?"</p>

                    <p>"Where would you go if you had to book a one-way ticket for next friday, to anywhere in the world?"</p>

                    <p>"Why have you been putting off the thing your most want to do? Stop lying to yourself."</p>

                    <p>There's a group of right here in State College that live for it. We created Coffee Stain for that very purpose. <br><br>
                    Every week we'll curate a topic, assign you a coffee conversation partner, time, and coffeehouse. It'll be a conversation that you can actually sink your teeth into.<br><br>

                     <i>No more</i> conversations discussing what you should get at Panda express in the HUB tonight. Coffeestain hooks you up with conversations so good that they'll keep you up at night because you're still thinking about what the other person said. </p>

                     <p>Everyone once in a while, we'll take a break from the coffee matches and host a cocktail and appetizer hour (or two) too.</p>


                     And, <i>for a bit while longer</i>, we're accepting new members. Here's how you can snag a spot:
